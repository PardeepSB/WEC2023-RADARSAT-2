## About

Elementry level game that Highlights ecological relationships within the coastal marine biome, Provides a challenging 2D platformer experience, and tests children on what knowledge they had acquired.

## Usage

1. Open downloaded repo in Unity and click on File.
2. Go to Build Settings.
3. Go to player settings tab in that dialog box.
4. Configure your game settings (screen splash,game name,company name,etc,etc)
5. Select your platform (win/mac/linux/xbox/etc etc)
6. Click on build, save file location.
7. 7. open .exe file to run game

## Directions for using Program
	
1. Use W,A,S,D to navigate your character (Sea Lionel)
       
2. Try not to get caught my Orca's or human fishing nets

3. Make it to the end of the map and begin quiz on all the knowledge you acquired during the game

## Work Flow

	- Project rolled out using agile methodology with 3 sprints
    - 1st sprint was focused on creating normal functioning characters and game objects
    - 2nd sprint was focused on creation of screen menu's, pause and death mechanics
    - 3rd sprint was focused on the Tracker/Question asking GUI mechanics

## Future Improvements

 - Fill in missing storyboard elements (Cutscenes, Dialogue, Sky Features)
 - Missing Combat implementation (eating other fish)
 - Drowning/Lung Capacity System
 - More Visuals
 - Smoother movement of main characters
 - Fixed game physics
 - Merge progress with tracker
